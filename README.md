# Missile Command Game on ARM Mbed
Missile Command is a well-known classic arcade game that involves protecting cities by shooting incoming missiles. I implemented this using an mbed kit (consisting of an LCD screen, push buttons, accelerometer, speaker, etc) and online mbed C compiler. Working on this project forced me to further develop my memory allocation and hardware debugging skills. I used a linked list to keep track of all player and enemy missiles on the screen, which meant I had to have good memory management skills if I didn't want errors to occur. Additionally, as with any embedded project, good wire management and organization was essential for smooth hardware debugging. The game featured multiple levels, multi-colored explosions, retro sound effects, high score rankings, level skipping, and more.
